This documentation was created to help you learn how to use Codeed.Framework and create your own applications. It is divided into sections that will guide you through the process of creating a system using the framework.

## What will we learn

In this documentation, we will learn how to use Codeed.Framework to create a complete system. The topics covered include:

* Creating a backend project using Visual Studio
* Configuring the project to use Codeed.Framework
* Creating an entity to represent the system data
* Creating entity mappings to allow persistence in the database
* Creating contexts and repositories to access the system data
* Creating CRUD services to perform basic operations in the system

With the knowledge gained in this documentation, you will be able to use Codeed.Framework in your own projects and create scalable and high-quality systems. Let's get started!
